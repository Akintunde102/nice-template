# VanHack's Event Page
- Create an app&nbsp;to display VanHack's upcoming and past events/activities. Quite Like this: https://vanhack.com/platform/#/events
- The event types: `MeetUp`, `Leap`, `Recruiting Mission`, `VanHackathon`, `Premium-only Webinar`, `Open Webinar`

## FUNCTIONALITY
- a user should be able to:
	- Apply to an event and see confirmation of their application
	- See more details of an event
	- Share the event with a friend (through LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc – your choice)
- Non-Premium members should see 
    - a friendly error warning when trying to apply for a Premium-only webinar, with a CTA for the candidate to read more about Premium/buy a membership plan

## DESIGN
- `Leap`, `Mission` and `VanHackathon` events should visually stand out to candidates the most
- `Premium-only webinars` should be visually distinguished from the “open for all” webinars

## Note
